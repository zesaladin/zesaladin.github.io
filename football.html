    <h1>Football </h1>
</header>

<p>  My favorite place at USC is when I'm at work, 50 feet in the air.
I work for USC Football on the video team, and my job is mostly to film practice so coaches can use it to teach skills.
I first was trying out to be a manager, but after two months of that, I knew I wouldn't have the time to commit to it.
When I told the head manager, he mentioned there was a job in the video department open.
Knowing the speed of practice, and having filmed things, including sports, before, I learned very quickly.
The job itself isn't that challenging: anyone can do it if they can follow instructions, communicate, and occasionally think on their feet.
That first photo is from my first day on the job, when I went up on the lift in July and saw the USC campus, DTLA, and the mountains beyond.
Not many places in LA are that high up, and while it is sometimes scary, hanging in the middle of an open field, it does have a great view.
Most days, I can put in one headphone, play my favorite music, and watch my favorite sport, all while getting paid. -MP
