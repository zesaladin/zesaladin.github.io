      <p> Hello! I'm a red tailed hawk named Cinnamon. You can find me at Kenneth Hahn or in the documentary. </p>
      <p>You also can see some other birds around here. The bird below me is a female Mallard who live in Los Angeles, the bird to my left is a Northern Cardinal who lives on Long Island, and the color changing fellow is a Southern carmine bee-eater who lives in South Africa. </p>
      <p> I don't know how those last two made it on the website but they have some great travel stories. </p>

      <h2> Abstract </h2>
      <p> As The Birds Fly explores the culture of bird watching in Los Angeles and its
intersection with climate change and sustainability. A subculture that is often
portrayed one dimensionally, As the Birds Fly captures the subtleties and intricacies of birding.
This thesis takes the form of a short documentary, which includes interviews with birders, as well as scientists and researchers who speak more directly to the issues facing birds and our environment.
</p><p>
Bird watching is one of the most widespread pastimes in America, as over 43
million people reported watching birds in 2016. The National Audubon Society,
which was founded to protect birds, has over 500 chapters and over 500,000
members. Bird watchers have their own social norms and language, and while what
they are doing is recreational, through their observations they are also seeing the
real effects of climate change, often before others do. Birders have noticed changes
in bird populations, and many are considering the implications of climate change on
their hobby and the animals they admire.

      <p style="margin:4%"> This is Stephanie, who you will meet if you watch the documentary. Over to the left of the video, you'll also see James, who is also featured in the story.
      I met both of them at about 8AM at Kenneth Hahn State Park over winter break, as we were all on one of LA Audubon's many bird walks.
      While I didn't have a video camera, on that one walk we saw almost 40 species of birds, including two types of hawks, two owls, and an Osprey catching a fish.
      We also saw a duck get trapped in a fishing line, and James had to pull it out.

      <h2> Process </h2>
      <p> I started coming up with ideas for my thesis in September of 2019, but didn't really decide on what I wanted to do until at least October.
        While I have always liked taking pictures of birds, I never considered myself a bird watcher, but after seeing an episode of High Maintenance featuring a birder, I felt that this was a deep, caring community.
        Then, I read an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/climate/state-birds-climate-change.html" target="_blank"> article</a> highlighting how state birds were vanishing from their states.
