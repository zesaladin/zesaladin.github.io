    <h1> Eulogy for Sensor Osden </h1>
<p>
  Sensor Osden, left behind on World 4470, lived for his short time on Earth with immense abilities and overwhelming pain. Raised by Dr. Hammergeld, who treated him for acute autism, he grew up to be a brave young Hainishman, venturing off to distant worlds in search of new life and future homes. Mr. Osden was chosen for these voyages because of his disability and unique ability, his capacity for empathy. He was able to pick up on emotions, not only human but animal, and in his last recorded discovery, of plant life as well. He described emotion as “the psychic excreta of the animal kingdom,” and while he was a great aide for scientific purposes, his life was littered with the sadness and doubt that others projected on to him. Despite often being bombarded by these feelings, he was a punctual, astute, and careful man. When he committed to tasks, he gave a hundred percent, never failing to accomplish his goals. His perseverance in learning how to manage his empathic ability cannot be understated, as it was a challenge that few have known and fewer have overcome. Although he could understand others, he was himself often misunderstood, having to retreat from human interaction from time to time. His friends and family, who did not see him or his crew return from their journey due to the fluctuations of time in space travel, can rest knowing that he found a lasting peace and community on World 4470, being embraced by the hive-mind of plants that existed there.
